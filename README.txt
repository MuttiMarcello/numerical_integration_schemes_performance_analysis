# Numerical Methods Performance Analysis

Academic project implementing and analysing performance of diverse numerical methods for zero-finding and ODE integration.

## Overview

This repository contains a study developed as part of a university modeling and simulation project.

The work includes:
1. Implementation and performance assessment of zero-finding Newton's method
2. Implementation and performance assessment of RK2, RK4 methods for ODE initial-value-problem solution
3. Stability region analysis of RK2, RK4 methods
4. Accuracy region analysis of RK1, RK2, RK4 methods
5. Implementation and stability region analysis of BI2-theta methods
6. Implementation and performance assessment of RK4, IEX4 methods for ODE initial-value-problem solution
7. Implementation and performance assessment of AB3, AM3, ABM3, BDF3 methods for ODE initial-value-problem solution

The full methodology and results (including plots) are available in 'docs/report.pdf'.
